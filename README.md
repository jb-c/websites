# Websites
Links to websites that I have made.

## Bradford Anaesthetic Services
[Website Link](http://basdoctors.co.uk/).
A wordpress website made for a group of Anaesthetists.
I worked with the doctors to design, create and test a much needed update to their company website. This project taught me how to professionally communicate new ideas and impliment feedback from the client. 

## Edale Cottage Orkney
[Website Link](http://www.dalecottageorkney.co.uk). 
A wordpress website made for the owner of a holiday cottage.
I helped to client to increase her online presance by designing and creating a simple website to advertise her holiday home. This project was particullarly challenging with the lack of high quality photos provided by the client and the client's technical knowledge.
